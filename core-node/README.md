# What is Node.js?

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows you to build fast and scalable web applications using JavaScript. Imagine it like a "superhero" for JavaScript that lets you do much more than just create websites!

# What's in this Project?

This project includes a basic "calculator" that can add and subtract numbers. It also has tests to make sure it works correctly.

Let's Get Started!

1. **What you'll need:**

   - **A computer:** This project will work on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
   - **Node.js:** Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version for your computer. Install it as instructed.
   - **A text editor:** You can use any text editor you like (e.g., Notepad++, Sublime Text, VS Code).

2. **Getting the project:**

   - **Download or clone:** You can either download the files from this repository or clone it using Git.
   - **Open a command prompt (or terminal):** Navigate to the folder where you downloaded or cloned the project.

3. **Install the tools:**

   - **Start:** `cd core-node/introduction-exercise` (This will navigate to the necessary folder)
   - **Run:** `npm install` (This will download all the necessary tools)

4. **Run the tests:**

   - **Run:** `npm run test` (This will check if the calculator works correctly)

5. **Build the application:**

   - **Run:** `npm run build` (This will create a file called `bundle.js` that contains all the code in one place)

6. **Start the server:**

   - **Run:** `npm run start` (This will start a web server that shows you the results of the calculator)
   - **HTML:** `core-node/introduction-exercise/public/index.html` file contains a simple code to load the html in the browser on the next point.

7. **Open a web browser:** Go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the results!

8. **Open a console and Run:** `npm run dev` (This will shows you the results of the calculator in the terminal console)

**That's it! You've successfully run your first Node.js project!**

**What's next?**

- **Explore the code:** Look at the files and see how they work.
- **Change the calculator:** Try adding more functions (like multiplication or division).
- **Learn more:** There are tons of resources online for learning Node.js. Check out [https://nodejs.org/en/docs/](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) or search on YouTube for tutorials!

Enjoy your journey into the world of Node.js!
